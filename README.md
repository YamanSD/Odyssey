An unfinished 2D game engine built from scratch strictly using vanilla JS. Currnetly NOT maintained, will later be optimized and repurposed for game I have in mind.

# Usage

To demonstrate some of the features of the engine, I created a tiny woeful remake of Mega Man X4.

To use it simply open the `index.html` file in any browser of your choice.
